"""AgentCore Platform v1.0 — RET-C2-338 HTTP entry point.

Entry points are adapters only — no business logic here. For platform-level
routing, AgentGateway calls agent.invoke() directly.

Entry authentication (implemented by entry_adapter.auth):
  - a verified middleware trust (request.state.trust_level) is used as-is;
  - otherwise INVOKE_AUTH_TOKEN Bearer auth promotes ANONYMOUS →
    VERIFIED_EXTERNAL (_resolve_trust raises 401 on token mismatch);
  - an unauthenticated caller (no verified middleware trust AND no token
    promotion) is rejected with 401. The old fallback that defaulted such
    callers to ANONYMOUS-into-invoke was fail-open (S-1 bypass) and is removed.
